# Motivation
This is demo project for learning the WebGL. Initally this was attempt to render the water, but turns out that there are lot more to do in WebGL

Right now it can
* render terrain from heightmap (javascript transformation)
* render reflection / refraction / waves on water ([this](http://chinedufn.com/3d-webgl-basic-water-tutorial/) tuttorial helped me a lot)
* render light
* render weird sun and sky (I've tried [this](https://www.alanzucconi.com/2017/10/10/atmospheric-scattering-1/) tuttorial, but it did not perfomed quite well, so I used fake but [fast](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MsVSWt) scattering instead)
* supports some keyboard / mouse interaction
