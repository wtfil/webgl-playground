# Motivation
This is demo project for learning the WebGL. Initally this was attempt to render the water, but turns out that there are lot more to do in WebGL

Right now it can
* render terrain from heightmap (javascript transformation)
* render reflection / refraction / waves on water
* render light
* render weird sun and sky (ussing [this](https://www.alanzucconi.com/2017/10/10/atmospheric-scattering-1/) tuttorial, but defenetelly there is some bug in my implementation)
* supports some keyboard / mouse interaction
